# MIDIchlorians
[MIDI]-[C]onversion to [H]armonic [L]ullabies of [O]ur Nea[R]by [I]rradiant G[A]laxy [N]eighbor[S] <br>
(If I don't create a wonky, near-nonsensical acronym for a title, am I even associated with astronomy?)

This project set out to faciliate the conversion of FITS image data into sound and has culminated in a user-friendly GUI, developed in python. 

Please visit this repository's wiki at https://github.com/Kyssuber/midichlorians/wiki/Getting-Started for specific setup instructions and details on the various interface features!

See the requirements.txt file to review the required packages & versions in order to successfully run the main script.

Once all setup configurations are set, navigate to your terminal window and type the following to begin your sonification journey: <br>
`python midigui.py -params params.txt`
