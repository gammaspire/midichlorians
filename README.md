# MIDIchlorians
[MIDI]-[C]onversion to [H]armonic [L]ullabies of [O]ur Nea[R]by [I]rradiant G[A]laxy [N]eighbor[S] <br>
(If I don't create a wonky, near-nonsensical acronym for a title, am I even associated with astronomy?)

This project set out to faciliate the conversion of FITS image data into sound and has culminated in a user-friendly GUI, developed in python. 

Please visit this repository's wiki at https://github.com/gammaspire/midichlorians/wiki/Getting-Started for specific setup instructions and details on the various interface features!

See the requirements.txt file to review the required packages & versions in order to successfully run the main script.

Once all setup configurations are set and the params.txt is updated according to your preferences, navigate to your terminal window and type the following to begin your sonification journey: <br>
`python midigui.py -params params.txt`
